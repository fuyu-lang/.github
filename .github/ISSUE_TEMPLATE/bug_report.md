<!--
Fuyu projects use a freeform issue template, so we rely on contributors to read these brief instructions before submitting an issue.

Before opening an issue, check whether a similar issue exists and contribute to it instead of opening a new one.

Consider including the following information where applicable:

- **Describe the Bug**: A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
- **How to Reproduce**: Steps to reproduce the behavior.
- **Expected Behavior**: A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
- **Environment**: Project version, operating system, etc.
- **Additional Context**: Add any other context about the problem here (additional description, notes, logs, screenshots, etc.).
- Some other format or sections if you feel that would better convey the bug.

Do not use issues for asking a question or for support. Use GitHub Discussions at https://github.com/orgs/fuyu-lang/discussions instead.
