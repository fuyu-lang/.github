<!--
Fuyu projects use a freeform issue template, so we rely on contributors to read these brief instructions before submitting an issue.

Before opening an issue, check whether a similar issue exists and contribute to it instead of opening a new one.

For this type of issue, it is up to the contributor to decide on the appropriate content. Consider whether this issue is better suited to be opened as a bug report or a feature request.

Do not use issues for asking a question or for support. Use GitHub Discussions at https://github.com/orgs/fuyu-lang/discussions instead.
