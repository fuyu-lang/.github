<!--
Fuyu projects use a freeform issue template, so we rely on contributors to read these brief instructions before submitting an issue.

Before opening an issue, check whether a similar issue exists and contribute to it instead of opening a new one.

Consider including the following information where applicable:

- **Describe the Problem**: A clear and concise description of what problem the feature request should solve.
- **Describe the Solution**: A clear and concise description of what solution you would like.
- **Describe any Alternatives**: A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features.
- **Additional Context**: Any other context about the feature request here.
- Some other format or sections if you feel that would better convey the feature request.

Do not use issues for asking a question or for support. Use GitHub Discussions at https://github.com/orgs/fuyu-lang/discussions instead.
